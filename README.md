# All-Fit

A simple to use fitness app to plan your workouts with pre-added exercises, or add your own. Avaliable for iOS on the app store [now](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/all-fit/id1549462820)!

## Features
- Add your own focus area and exercises. 

## Implementation
- In order to store the new focus areas from the user, I had to use Core Data since the data to be stored is all related such as an exercises unit (reps, minutes, miles). I also played around quite a bit with animations to allow for a better experience and have the user be more engaged.

## Lessons Learned
- This was my first app after learning Swift for less than a month. So the whole process of marketing, submitting the app, and following all guidelines and requirements was pretty daunting. As of the writing of this README file, I feel like I missed out on some key features such as saving workouts into playlist.
- Working with Core Data as well was brand new for me in this project, and I have learned quite a bit and allowed for me to have greater success in my All Keys app.
